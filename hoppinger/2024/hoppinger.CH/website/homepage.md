# Dr. Giuseppe Maggiore Consulting GmbH

## About me
Hello! I am Dr Giuseppe Maggiore, (fractional) CTO and digital transformation specialist based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.

I have been building high-end software and leading technical teams for almost than twenty years.

Be it new software or existing legacy application, I am always happy to help.

My work involves:
- understanding and analysing business requirements
- plotting those requirements on a strategic roadmap
- defining a project scope and requirements
- creating a technical/strategic software architecture
- assembling a team of prfessionals
- writing the actual code
- going live (which is an art on its own)
- setting up continuous delivery (because there is an infinite stream of good ideas!)

I am used to doing this alone, or within an existing team, but my secret superpower are my amazing colleagues and teammates from [Hoppinger](https://www.hoppinger.com/en/team), in the exciting city of Rotterdam: about 70 strong, together we have built many amazing digital transformations for all sorts of organisations.

## Services
My services cover everything you could dream about when dealing with strategic digital transformation: from problem analysis down to development and hosting.

## Cases
Existing projects showcase expertise and a maker's pride, but they also represent a veritable treasure trove of solutions that can be readily reused: after all, we don't need to reinvent the wheel all the time!
