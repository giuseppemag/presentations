# Automating rental on a real-estate platform
Thousands of students.
Hundreds of rooms and shared houses.
Government regulations.
Great scarcity, and complex priority rules to ensure fairness.
Dozens of backoffice employees manually "babysitting" the ERP.

When we first started the project, it was clear that the situation was not sustainable. The complex process that ends up with a student getting a room was performed manually by backoffice employees who knew all the rules by heart.

It was a slow, error-prone, boring process. Students needed to wait unnecessarily, employees needed to work much harder than needed, and short-stay peak season was a source of panic and stress for everyone.

But there was light at the end of the tunnel.

## ERP-connected webshop+portal
We designed, architected, and built a project that some considered even too ambitious. 

A high-quality custom self-service software that allowed students to:
- browse available units
- estimate their chances of getting the given unit based on the priority rules
- pick a unit
- sign the contract digitally
- pay online
- get a digital key on their smartphone
- manage their rental contract, request repairs, end the contract

Every single step is automated. The whole process can last as little as a few minutes, and all happens from a smartphone or a PC.

Sometimes though, the process gets stuck somewhere. Either a student cannot submit the relevant enrollment documents, a payment does not go through, etc. 
The portal also features an employee interface, where employees can:
- see all rental processes that are stuck and intervene
- see all active and past contracts
- impersonate a student in the portal in order to offer better help by "watching over the shoulder"
- inspect all data from all relevant systems: ERP, DMS, contracts, etc.

## Results
The results are nothing short of spectacular. 

The vast majority (90% or more) of units are rented fully automatically without backoffice intervention.
The number of backoffice employees who need to work fulltime on the rental process is reduced by 70%.
The number of ERP licenses is reduced by 90%.
Uptime of the system is as close as it gets to 100%.

And thanks to continuous delivery, we keep booking improvements for both students and internal employees.
