# Website and product configurator from SAP
Hundreds of products.
Thousands of product variations and accessories.
Complex compatibility rules between product variations and accessories.
Complex pricing model.
Tens of thousands of clients all over the globe.
Almost any combination of language and country supported.
Thousands of resellers all over the globe.

Resellers everywhere in the world where using a huge, unwieldy mega-Excel sheet to configure products to spec for their clients. The catch?
Errors where all too common. Wrong, incompatible product configurations were ordered all the time, old versions of the Excel sheet would be used to configure products or variants that did not exist anymore, and old or outright wrong prices were the norm.

But we set out to fix this for good.

## ERP-connected website+product configurator
We designed, architected, and built an ambitious project.

A multi-language, multi-site headless system that would also fetch data from the SAP ERP in real-time for up-to-date product information into a product configurator for resellers.

This allowed customers to:
- browse the offering in their own language
- access country-specific information
- contact the right reseller

The reseller could:
- configure products without mistakes
- always pick actual products
- only pick compatible, supported configuration
- always end up with the right price

The system features a high degree of automation. No more outdated, unwieldy, Excel sheets, and always the right answer.

After all, it's all about getting the right product configuration to the client the smoothest way possible.
