# B2B horeca e-learning webshop
Thousands of recipes, ingredient information, and knowledge articles.
Thousands of horeca professionals, from students to veterans.
Dozens of expert publishers and sponsors.

When we first started the project, it was clear that the sheer volume of the application would require a flawless and full automation on top of a fantastic user experience. The amount of content required best-in-class search capabilities. The number of customers and payments needed to run as much as possible without human intervention.

Publication of new content and marketing activities must be simplified and streamlined to the next level.

## ERP-connected webshop+portal+website
We designed, architected, and built a project with nothing short of amazing features.

A high-quality custom self-service website+webshop that allowed customers to:
- browse available products
- start a trial
- purchase a subscription
- pay online
- manage their catalogue
- create and share their own content

Every single step is automated. The whole onboarding of a customer can last as little as a few minutes, and it all happens from a smartphone or a PC.

The system is connected to a Business Central ERP. Thousands of orders, invoices, and their payments are created automatically, allowing a team of 0 (zero!) financial specialists to manage tens of thousands of transactions.

Even the edge cases are fully automated: missed payments, reminders, as well as cancellation of contracts are all done without any form of user intervention.

## Results
The results are great!

Backoffice employees are fully focused on creating value. New recipes are created and uploaded with a low-code PowerApp on a tablet, because when you are cooking with greasy fingers big buttons are the best. Marketing activities and special offers are managed with a state of the art DMS/CMS based on Sharepoint Online.

As a result, the platform is an international powerhouse, connecting and empowering professionals all over the world with a minimal crew of hyper-effective in-house experts.


Cheers and _bon appetit_!
