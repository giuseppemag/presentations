# B2B healthcare wholesale marketplace
Thousands of healthcare products.
Dozens of suppliers.
Dozens of buyers.
Each buyer has different prices, processes, roles, and rights.

When we first started the product, it was clear that the situation required a new kind of architecture. The huge variety of different ERPs from the various suppliers, paired with the huge variety of procurement systems from the different buyers, as well as the many purchase processes that need to be supported looked daunting.

This is simply not something that can be done manually, at least not without an army of salespeople and backoffice employees.

But that is not how we roll.

## ERP-connected webshop+portal
We designed, architected, and built a project that on paper looked almost impossible.

A high-quality custom self-service software that allowed buyers to:
- browse available products
- see their customized discounts
- purchase (according to their company' process)
- pay online
- manage their orders, repeat old orders, see invoices, etc.

Every single step is automated. The whole process can last as little as a few minutes, and all happens from a smartphone or a PC.

All data is aggregated into a single Business Central ERP. Our custom portal communicates with the ERP in order to bring a high quality UX to life.

Sometimes though, the process gets stuck somewhere. A buyer orders a product that was supposed to be available but is not anymore, a payment does not go through, etc. 
The portal also features an employee interface, where employees can:
- see all orders that are stuck and intervene
- see all active and past orders and invoices
- impersonate a buyer in the portal in order to offer better help by "watching over the shoulder"
- inspect all data from all relevant systems: ERP, DMS, contracts, etc.

## Results
The results are nothing short of spectacular. 

The vast majority (90% or more) of purchases happen fully automatically without backoffice intervention.
The number of backoffice employees who need to work fulltime on the rental process is reduced by 70%.
The number of ERP licenses is reduced by 90%.
Uptime of the system is as close as it gets to 100%.

And thanks to continuous delivery, we keep booking improvements for both students and internal employees.
