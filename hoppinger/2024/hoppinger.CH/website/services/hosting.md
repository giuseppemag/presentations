# Hosting

> The washing machine of the digital transformation

It is very rare to encounter a modern house without electricity: almost impossible as a matter of fact!

Similarly, it is very rare, almost impossible, to encounter a modern digital transformation without any form of hosting!

Hosting, just like electricity at home, is an essential commodity: we all expect it to work whenever we want, and as long as it works we pay no attention to it, but when it stops working, it is very stressful and disruptive.

Modern hosting needs to be always available. Even the shortest interruptions are simply unacceptable. Moreover, hosting needs to be up to date, secure, and supported by all sorts of mechanisms such as backups and disaster recovery (such as redundancy, ideally across multiple data centers).

We offer two, equally advanced and reliable forms of hosting: on Azure, and on our own private cloud in the EU. Both variations support exceptionally high uptimes, are hardened (and ISO 27001 certified across the whole chain), redundant, and capable of disaster recovery with fast restore times.

The lights must stay on!
