# Leading digital transformation

Creating a technical team is quite a challenge. Finding the right people is just the very first step, but there is much more to it.

The mantra that we should always apply is "what about the business?": what is the goal that the technical team needs to fulfill for the business?

For example, the team that will need to maintain a legacy on-prem app will need to be thorough, slow, and hyper-analytical: getting into legacy logic without breaking anything or getting frustrated requires a sort of professional wisdom and in some cases even the age that goes with it :)

On the other hand, the team that will need to build a creative web site will need to be dynamic, agile, and visual: fast iterations, cutting edge technology, moving fast and breaking things require young (at least at heart!) designer/developer/creative professionals.

And then the million dollar question: how should their work be setup?

## From company to organization
Hiring a bunch of smart professionals and letting them loose is not enough. If we bring such energy into the equation, we want to make sure that:
- everyone works towards the same goal
- everyone works in an interchangeable way
- everyone works in their area of maximum impact

This, unfortunately, does not happen on its own, and requires careful study and iteration. The definition of the right roles and processes, makes the difference between a chaotic group of people often working against each other (despite their best intentions) and a true organisation (well, it is in the word right?).

Two examples illustrate this sort of thing excellently in my opinion: the mythical role of "the fullstack dev", and the terrifying tale of "deadline vs scope vs budget".

### The mythical fullstack dev
The mythical fullstack dev refers to an imaginary creature that is capable of administering hosting infrastructure, managing a database, setting up the database schema, writing performant queries, writing an API, and of course also writing a frontend, styling it, and designing it a little bit. Ah, and let's not forget security!!!

Of course such a person does not exist. Full stop. Even if such a person existed, the variations in quality of their output would be unmanageable, and the dependency on such a teammate would also be a nightmare: they go on holiday? Bam! Company stops.

The much better solution is to hire different people, and to make sure that they work on smaller workpackages. A database and API expert is a much easier professional to find. So is a designer who can also work on HTML/CSS. And so on.

One of the nicest side effects of this team structure is that a chain of work comes to be. This chain of work creates process, but it also allows working on different phases of different features at the same time.

### The terrifying tale of "deadline vs scope vs budget"
How does one go from idea to a tangible product? Unless we are starting from scratch, the context of an assignment is usually pretty complex: existing clients, existing stakeholders, existing legacy functionality we need to stay compatible with, all form a hidden network of requirements that will take quite a lot of time and effort in order to be met.

The most common tangible proof of this are big delays in projects: what started out as an elevator pitch that was estimated as a few weeks of work snowballed into a huge project that cost months or years of effort on behalf of the whole team. And even worse: every release requires a lot of feedback and a lot of rework!

The much better solution is to start with a clear definition of the scope. Understanding why and what we need to build a given system or epic or feature is essential in order to understand how many and what type of resources we need.

Defining the scope happens in layers. We usually start with some background and goal documentation, but we then move on to the detailed list of epics and requirements and acceptance criteria.

When all of this is understood, we can start with a definition of wireframes and dataflow - how does the user interact with the underlying data from which systems. This can already support the first phase of implementation: APIs and basic interactions can be built already when we know the core of the system

Further detailing of designs into pixel-perfect visuals closes the circle. This becomes the input for the styling team who will bring the product to life with their visual magic.


## In short
Setting up a technical team needs an understanding of business goals and requirements, in order to assemble the team and their way of working for optimal impact and output.
