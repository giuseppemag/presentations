# ERP integrations
The ERP is the beating heart of any strategic digital transformation. 

A well-structured ERP can support and enhance all sorts of operations. Of course the core business of the ERP is financial administration, namely the registration and organisation of credits and debits.

A modern ERP can do much more of course. The whole process that leads to income or expenses is a direct reflection of the value-exchange that an organisation has with its clients and suppliers. A good translation of this business process into the ERP (the famed _implementation_) will support and facilitate best practices, and discourage or outright prevent bad practices or mistakes.

But! There is a but hiding there :)

## The risk of overengineered ERPs
A big risk is to end up with a heavily overengineered ERP. The industry-leading ERPs (SAP, BusinessCentral, Salesforce, Finance and Operations, etc.) all support all manner of customisation.

Some of this customisation is not only harmless, but actually very useful. Setting up dimensions, extra fields, disabling unused functionality, etc. is all part of the normal setup of an ERP.

Some of this customisation is actually very risky: building too much API or custom logic with custom programming code _inside the ERP_ can cause lots of headaches down the line. First of all, there is a limited number of very expensive specialists that can work with such custom plugins. And second, too much customisation will make maintenance much harder: the supplier of the ERP regularly releases updates and upgrades, and those will almost always break the custom plugins because of course the ERP supplier does not take our custom plugins into account.

## The rise of the headless ERP
Virtually all the serious enterprise-grade ERPs feature something that allows us to skip the writing of custom plugins almost entirely: an extensive API.

Thanks to this API, an external system will be able to read and write to any entity, in order to create novel presentations of the data and processes inside the ERP, as well as change or drive the internal processes of the ERP from outside.

Thanks to the API, we can setup an external application, on the web or native, and allow external users to interact directly with ERP data. For example, we could build a native app that allows a user to see their orders and invoices, repeat an order, or even pay directly online. Welcome the _custom portal_ strategy.

This does not only translate to a better, digital-first user experience for customers: it can even lead to more upselling (for example well-timed, relevant notifications of discounts or new products) and faster cash flow (for example notifications about discounts for early payments).

By using state of the art, enterprise technology that is made for apps and web portals, we can build top of the bill user experiences that are smooth, beautiful, and last but not least: unencumbered by per-seat licenses, so also much cheaper to run!

### Not only for clients
The larger the organisation, the bigger the backoffice. Managing resource availability, customer-specific pricing and discounts, returns, and in general making sure that everything runs smoothly is the responsibility of the unsung heroes of the digital transformation world: the backoffice employees!

Custom portals built on top of ERPs are not only meant for end users: they can also offer great help to backoffice employees. For example, our custom portal could allow backoffice employees to login, see which users are getting stuck somewhere in the process, impersonate those users to better understand how to help them, and then find the best way to get them going. Or we could automate and streamline parts of the purchase process and the various steps required so that internal users get done efficiently and effectively.

## In short...
The ERP is the core of the digital transformation. Thanks to custom portals, the ERP can be empowered without excessive customisation. The ERP itself stays clean and true to its function, and both end users and internal users can be empowered to achieve their goals faster and better!
