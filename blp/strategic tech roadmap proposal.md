# <!-- fit --> Three horizons for BLP tech
by Dr Giuseppe Maggiore

---

# Agenda
the three horizons model
the strategic end goal
the current situation
the way towards

---

# Three horizons
start with the end in mind: what do we want to achieve? Go for a BHAG!
look where you are now
determine the three horizons (big strategic steps) towards the BHAG

---

# The BHAG
> BO defines a clear strategic roadmap and prioritization framework
> BO+PO think up features and epics and define requirements.
> A clear and detailed design is iterated with all relevant stakeholders.
> The development team works as one mind and delivers quickly and efficiently.

---

# The BHAG
The product is 100% resilient and 100% versatile.
Resilient: no bugs, no downtime, no regressions.
Versatile: any extension is possible, without huge overhead.

---

# The BHAG - resilience of codebase
high security/privacy
high quality
high standardization
high parameterization
high automation
high modularity
zero fragmentation

---

# The BHAG - resilience of infra
simple
cheap
easy to work with
100% safe

---

# The current situation of the roadmap
⚠️ BO defines a clear strategic roadmap and prioritization framework
❌ The BO+PO think up features and epics and define requirements.
❌ A clear and detailed design is iterated with all relevant stakeholders.
❌ The development team works as one mind and delivers quickly and efficiently.

---

# The current situation of the codebase
⚠️ high security/privacy
❌ high quality
❌ high standardization
❌ high parameterization
❌ high automation
❌ high modularity
❌ zero fragmentation

---

# The current situation of the infra
❌ simple
❌ cheap
❌ easy to work with
⚠️ 100% safe

---

# The way towards
The focus of the first horizon is on:
> ❌ A clear and detailed design is iterated with all relevant stakeholders.
> ❌ The development team works as one mind and delivers quickly and efficiently.


---

# The way towards - step 1
🔝 high standardization
🔝 high parameterization
🔝 high automation
🔝 high modularity
🔝 clear and detailed design iterated

---

# The way towards - step 2
⬆️ zero fragmentation (repos and teams)
⬆️ high quality
➡️ high security/privacy
➡️ the BO+PO think up features and epics and define requirements.

---

# The way towards - step 3
➡️ infra is simple
➡️ infra is cheap
➡️ infra is easy to work with
➡️ infra is 100% safe

---

# Horizon 1
At the end of horizon 1, new features will be developed effectively, efficiently, and without defects.

# Thank you!
Let's do this 💙
