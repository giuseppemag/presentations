# <!-- fit --> Personal improvement plan Konrad Barrek
by the BLP management and Dr Giuseppe Maggiore

---

# Agenda
original expectations vs current
adjusted expectations

---

# Originally expected vs current
given seniority and rank
given structure of the company

---

# Originally expected vs current
more independence
less "getting stuck"
more leadership
more all-round software engineering

---

# Originally expected vs current
the expectations of BLP are not met at this point

---

# Adjusted expectations
let's refocus around your stronger skills

---

# Adjusted expectations
pillars of new expectations
- lots of styling: average of three web1.9 cards a week prod-ready
- process leadership: make sure the board is used properly
- effective alignment with design: make design converge on usable deliverables
- effective alignment with stakeholders: participate in design verify sessions with Sven/other team members

---

# Conclusion
current expectations not fully met
refocus on strong suits
reconvene in a month to evaluate
