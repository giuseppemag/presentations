# <!-- fit --> Tasks until and tasks after the 1/10 deadline
by Dr Giuseppe Maggiore

# Before 1/10
FI dashboard in web2.0
web1.9 dashboard cards
web1.9 dashboard configuration
dashboard performance

---

# After 1/10
new view of all tables 
details forms: either restyle or redesign+rebuild
new defaulting system

# The BHAG
The product is 100% resilient and 100% versatile.
Resilient: no bugs, no downtime, no regressions.
Versatile: any extension is possible, without huge overhead.

---

# The BHAG - resilience of codebase
high security/privacy
high quality
high standardization
high parameterization
high automation
high modularity
zero fragmentation

---

# The BHAG - resilience of infra
simple
cheap
easy to work with
100% safe

---

# The current situation of the roadmap
⚠️ BO defines a clear strategic roadmap and prioritization framework
❌ The BO+PO think up features and epics and define requirements.
❌ A clear and detailed design is iterated with all relevant stakeholders.
❌ The development team works as one mind and delivers quickly and efficiently.
⚠️ Developers are happy to come, and stay for many years, at BLP.

# The current situation of the codebase

# The current situation of the infra

⚠️ 100% safe

---

# The way towards
The focus of the first horizon is on:
> ❌ A clear and detailed design is iterated with all relevant stakeholders.
> ❌ The development team works as one mind and delivers quickly and efficiently.

# And what if we don't?
Points of attention:
💀 Every developer writes whatever and however they want - no rules, no guidelines
💀 Copy-paste everywhere
💀 Lots of unnecessary code instead of build well once - reuse forever
💀 Different repositories (IT'S JUST ONE APPLICATION!!!)

---

# And what if we don't?
💀 Strategic decisions just happen in the teams
💀 Key individuals determine the course of the company around their own preferences

---

# And what if we don't?
💀 Things broken all the time
💀 Deployments in the backend break the frontend

---

# And what if we don't?
💀 Developers never own the whole feature from back- to frontend
💀 Specializations (DevOps/CSS) are not correctly isolated from dev

---

# And what if we don't?
💀 Non-versioned API
💀 Inconsistent API
💀 No self-documenting meta API (OpenAPI/OData)

---

# And what if we don't?
💀 Deadlines without estimates
💀 Estimates without scope
💀 Scope without design
💀 Design without requirements

---

# And what if we don't?
Three cautionary tales:
💀 Cies, Hoppinger's _coding CTO_
💀 Kirsten's "developers need to own and test better"
💀 The 256 VPS'es of Hoppinger vs Ubuntu 14
💀 The 37 EoL forked packages from Hoppinger
💀 Hoppinger' retention panic in 2019
💀 [VERY CONFIDENTIAL] van Oord and the unsolvable bug
💀 [VERY CONFIDENTIAL] Apotheek Partner's almost death

# If we continue like this, quality will keep going down, development time will keep going up

---

# The way towards - step 1
🔝 high standardization
🔝 high parameterization
🔝 high automation
🔝 high modularity
🔝 clear and detailed design iterated

---

# The way towards - step 2
⬆️ zero fragmentation (repos and teams)
⬆️ high quality
➡️ high security/privacy
➡️ the BO+PO think up features and epics and define requirements.

---

# The way towards - step 3
➡️ infra is simple
➡️ infra is cheap
➡️ infra is easy to work with
➡️ infra is 100% safe

---

# Horizon 1
At the end of horizon 1, new features will be developed effectively, efficiently, and without defects.

# Thank you!
Let's do this 💙
