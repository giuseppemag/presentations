# <!-- fit --> New process for web2.0
by Dr Giuseppe Maggiore

---

# Agenda
current situation
web1.9 vs web2.0
new process
expected release frequency

---

# Current situation
💀 we are not delivering fast enough
💀 the business requirements will not be met
💀 we need to change our approach

---

# Current situation
💀 designs not ready/too many iterations
💀 time per card suboptimal
💀 problematic dependency from API team

---

# Current situation
💙 quality and standardisation
💙 beautiful and ergonomic results
💙 new viewer is in dev!

---

# web1.9 vs web2.0
➡️ same process for web2.0 (setup+api → design)
⬆️ new! go-live MVP
⬆️ new! clear Jira/MS Planner process

---

# New process (planner lanes)
➡️ design web1.9 + web2.0
➡️ feedback from internal team
➡️ present to stakeholders (Sven + Prj team)
➡️ iterate

---

# New process (planner lanes)
➡️ after stakeholder approval start dev of web1.9
➡️ only styling: CSS/HTML
➡️ full copy of the current implementation
➡️ restyle that

---

# New process (planner lanes)
➡️ in parallel
➡️ only styling: CSS/HTML
➡️ full copy of the current implementation
➡️ restyle that

---

# Owners
💙 project lead: Giuseppe
💙 design: Eszter and Erik
💙 web1.9: Konrad, Michal, Joy
💙 web2.0: Dave, John, Giuseppe, Stefano
💙 board: Joy and Konrad
➡️ 15-minute standup every other day

---
# Expected release frequency/priorities
🕒 every week, _at least one_ web1.9 card per person
🏁 nothing new gets started until the previous task is in dev
⬆️ bugfixing from feedback has max prio

---
# Epic priorities
⬆️ finish new viewer (90% → 🏁)
⬆️ tasks view (90% → 🏁)
⬆️ web1.9
⬆️ SVGs for infinite resolution
⬆️ web2.0

---

# What's next?
we **crush** the deadline with web1.9
we **crush** the deadline with the new viewer
we **crush** the deadline with the tasks view
we **crush** the deadline with the SVGs
we _iteratively implement_ web2.0


---

# Thank you!
Let's do this 💙
