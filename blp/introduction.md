# Core expertise
- team leadership, dev hiring, multi-national teams, distributed teams, various tech stacks

# Why change?
- almost 10 years of agency work is...enough ðŸ˜‰
- in 2024 I will move from executive to non-executive and possibly prepare for exit/dividend
- I love your company culture and vibe and would like to collaborate, and possibly later work with you guys permanently
- I plan on soft-moving to Zurich in 2024 and permanently whenever I have a stable job and a plan of succession in place

# What do I bring to the table?
- I am available, ideally in consultancy form, for 2/3 days a week for now as an executive/sr architect
  - Tech growth (integrations, integrations, integrations)
  - Assisting as a sales engineer in CH and NL 
  - Streamlining and Q&A of the tech team
  - Whatever else you need, let's find out!
